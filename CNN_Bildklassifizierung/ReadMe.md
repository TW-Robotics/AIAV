Note: Use Tensorflow 2.4.1  (pip3 install tensorflow==2.4.1)

### How to use:
- download your model weights folder from your google drive (if you trained using google colab) or make sure your model weights fodler are in the right directory for the "model_name"
- "model_name" has to match your weights folder
-  run all cells. 
- if the device (webcam) can't be opened, try changing the devide_number to either -1, 0, 1 or 2. (This depends if your system has an internal camera or not)
- devide_number can also be used to switch between webcams if more than one is available
